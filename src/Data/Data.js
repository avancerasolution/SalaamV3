        content:'Salaam Takaful Limited is already providing a number of innovative takaful products to a wide range of sectors in Pakistan. We have a strong ambition to innovate and grow to a leading place in the Pakistani market. We intend to improve the livelihoods of crop producers (smallholders) as well as the efficiency of agricultural ecosystem in Pakistan.The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as the Global Goals, were adopted by the United Nations in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030 all people enjoy peace and prosperity. Adhering to the above, our aim is to create resilience in farmers and prevent them from falling into poverty by providing them Crop Parametric Takaful. It is a key component to achieve food security against the adverse effects of climate change. The UN World Food Programme notes that smallholder farmers produce most of the world’s food but tend to be food insecure themselves. Crop Parametric Takaful supports risk management in the food production value chain, thereby being a key component of measures to achieve food security. According to the WWF, disasters disproportionately affect the poorest communities and significantly increase hunger and malnutrition. Crop Parametric Takaful can mitigate hunger and enhance the resilience of vulnerable people to confront the nutritional effects of natural disasters and climate change. Farmers are most exposed to and suffer the most damages from climate risk. Furthermore, they have less resources available to repair and rebuild their lives after a catastrophic event. For the ease of farmers, we have designed a coverage that gives pay-out even during mid-season period, does not require any calamity to be declared by the government, takes into account the risk/loss suffered by a farmer on an individual basis rather than on a district level and does not require any manual loss assessment.
